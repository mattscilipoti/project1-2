# Project Feedback + Evaluation

When you came to me on Thursday, indicating you had some issues, I was slightly surprised, considering you didn't create a single issue throughout the week (https://github.com/ga-wdi-exercises/project1/issues?utf8=✓&q=is%3Aissue+involves%3Akimcabb).  Your first and last commit was on Thursday, 2/15.  This project is an important milestone in your course and we have little to work with.  Overall, I expected more from you and I know you can do better.  Let's meet ASAP to see what we can do to help you.


## Project Workflow:

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?


**Does not meet expectations:**
You have provided a rather thorough readme.  Unfortunately, I don't see this converted into code.  We've discussed taking small, verifiable steps.  Your first and last commit was on Thursday, 2/15.  Your code is rife with javascript errors.

## Technical Requirements

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Does not meet expectations:**
Your app is separated into the appropriate files.  I see you chose to go with a separate rules.html file.  Good job on both of these.

However, your deployed app has no functionality, just javascript errors.

For future projects, please do not clone the GA project repo.  Start with a fresh `git init`.  It makes grading harder and there's no benefit (no starter code, no solution, etc).  Our instructions were not clear on this.

## Code Quality

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Does not meet expectations:**
Your code is rife with javascript errors.  I have corrected quite a few and more remain.

Make sure to take a look at the inline code comments I made in this [pull request](https://github.com/kimcabb/project1/pull/1).

## Problem Solving

> Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Does not meet expectations:**
What happened?  Let's talk.

## Unsolved Problems

> I want to put question bank answers into an array to make them easier to access for counting correct/incorrect answers

That sounds like a great idea.  Let's get a basic app working first, then we can figure out how to DRY it up.

> Look into how to hide and show div in the page so game can all be on same page

Do you mean the "rules"?  Do you want to move them from the separate page onto this page?  Did you try googling "hide and show div"?
